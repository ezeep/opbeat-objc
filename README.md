opbeat-objc
===========

opbeat-objc is an Objective-C client for [Opbeat](http://www.opbeat.com). It's based on the excellent [raven-objc](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-objc) for Sentry.

This project is currently in prototype stage. Some parts of the code will break under certain conditions. Improvements and documentation will be available soon.
