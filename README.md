opbeat-objc is an Objective-C client for [Opbeat](http://www.opbeat.com). It's based on the excellent [raven-objc](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-objc) for Sentry.

### Proof-of-concept
This project is currently only a proof of concept. It is not recommended to use secret keys in client-side applications. Use at your own risk.
